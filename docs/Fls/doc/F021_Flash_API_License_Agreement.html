<p><b>Important  –  Read  carefully: </b> This Software License Agreement (“<b>Agreement</b>”) is a legal agreement between you and </p>
<p>Texas Instruments Incorporated (“<b>TI</b>”). In this Agreement “you” means you personally if you will exercise the rights granted </p>
<p>for your own benefit, but it means your company (or you on behalf of your company) if you will exercise the rights granted </p>
<p>for your company’s benefit. The “<b>Licensed Materials</b>” subject to this Agreement include the software programs and any </p>
<p>associated electronic documentation (in each case, in whole or in part), that accompany this Agreement and you access </p>
<p>“on-line”, as well as any updates or upgrades to such software programs or documentation, if any, provided to you at TI’s </p>
<p>sole  discretion.  The  Licensed  Materials  are  specifically  designed  and  licensed  for  use  solely  and  exclusively  with </p>
<p>semiconductor devices manufactured by or for TI (“<b>TI Devices</b>”). By installing, copying or otherwise using the Licensed </p>
<p>Materials you agree to abide by the provisions set forth herein. This Agreement is displayed for you to read prior to using </p>

<p>with the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and provided further that you shall be liable to TI for any </p>
<p>breach  by  your  contractors  of  this  Agreement  to  the  same  extent  as  you  would  be  if  you  had  breached  the </p>

<p>Upon termination of this Agreement, you will destroy any and all copies of the Licensed Materials in your possession, </p>
